# Bluetooth-Control-of-Solenoid-Valves

Description:
This Arduino project enables wireless control of hydraulic solenoid valves using a Bluetooth module, allowing the valves to be actuated remotely through simple commands sent from a mobile device or computer. The code listens for incoming Bluetooth serial data, interprets each command, and switches the corresponding solenoid outputs on or off to drive the hydraulic actuators. Designed for reliability and responsiveness, the system provides real-time control with minimal latency and includes safeguards to prevent unintended activation. This setup is ideal for prototyping soft robotics, fluid-powered mechanisms, and remote hydraulic actuation systems.
